Description: This is the interactive UI designs for an educational app that focused on financial literacy. 

             We presented these designs in response to our Business Challenge Summit. The challenge was to come up for a solution on how to activate novice inevstors to start their investing journey. 
             Our solution was to create this application that mimicked Duolingo and the Schwab app. 
             
             Due to the limited time and the virtual situation, we presented this link through a QR code that viewers were able to scan and view the app on their own phone. This created a more interactive experience.
